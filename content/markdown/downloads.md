**Disclaimer**

Apache SINGA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.
