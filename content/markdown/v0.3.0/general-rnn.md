# RNN in SINGA

---

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for modelling sequential data,
e.g., natural language sentences. In this page, we describe how to implement a
RNN application (or model) using SINGA built-in RNN layers. We will
use the [char-rnn modle](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) as an example,
which trains over setences or source code, with each character as an input
unit. Particularly, we will train a RNN using GRU over
[Linux kernel source code](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/).
After training, we expect to generate meaningful code from the model, like the
one shown by [Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
There is a [vanilla RNN example](rnn.html) for language modelling using user
defined RNN layers, which is different to using built-in RNN layers discribed
in this page.

  return disassemble(info->pending_bh);
}
```

## User configuration

The major diffences to the configuration of other models, e.g., feed-forward
models include,

1. the training algorithm should be changed to BPTT (back-propagation through time).
2. the layers and their connections should be configured differently.

The train one batch algorithm can be simply configured as

    train_one_batch {
      alg: kBPTT
    }

Next, we introduce the configuration of the neural net.

<p><strong> Fig.1 - Illustration of the structure of the Char-RNN model</strong></p>

Fig.1 illustrates the net structure of the char-rnn model. The input layer
buffers all training data (the Linux kernel code is about 6MB). For each
iteration, it reads `unroll_len +1` (`unroll_len` is configured by users)
successive characters, e.g., "int a;", and passes the first `unroll_len`
characters to `OneHotLayer`s (one per layer). Every `OneHotLayer` converts its
character into the one-hot vector representation. The input layer passes the
last `unroll_len` characters as labels to the `RNNLabelLayer` (the label of the
i-th character is the i+1 character, i.e., the objective is to predict the next
character).  Each `GRULayer` receives an one-hot vector and the hidden feature
vector from its precedent layer. After some feature transformation, its own
feature vector is passed to an inner-product layer and its successive
`GRULayer`. The i-th SoftmaxLossLayer measures the cross-entropy loss for
predicting the i-th character. According to Karpathy, there could be another
stack of `GRULayer`s connecting the first stack of `GRULayer`s, which improves
the performance if there is enough training data. The layer configuration is
similar to that for other models, e.g., feed-forward models. The major
difference is on the connection configuration.

### Unrolling length

To model the long dependency, recurrent layers need to be unrolled many times,
denoted as `unroll_len` (i.e., 50). According to our unified neural net
representation, the neural net should have configurations for `unroll_len`
recurrent layers. It is tedious
to let users configure these layers manually. Hence, SINGA makes it a
configuration field for each layer.  For example, to unroll the `GRULayer`,
users just configure it as,

    layer {
      type: kGRU
      unroll_len: 50
    }

Not only the `GRULayer` is unrolled, other layers like `InnerProductLayer` and
`SoftmaxLossLayer`, are also unrolled. To simplify the configuration, SINGA
provides a `unroll_len` field in the net configuration, which sets the
`unroll_len` of each layer configuration if the `unroll_len` is not configured
explicitly for that layer. For instance, SINGA would set the `unroll_len` of
the `GRULayer` to 50 implicitly for the following configuration.

    net {
      unroll_len: 50
       layer {
         type: kCharRNNInput
         unroll_len: 1  // configure it explicitly
       }
       layer {
         type: kGRU
         // no configuration for unroll_len
        }
     }

### ConnectionType

<p><strong> Fig.1 - Different RNN structures from [Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)</strong></p>

There would be many types of connections between layers in RNN models as shown
by Karpathy in Fig.2.  For each `srclayer`, there is a connection_type for it.
Taking the i-th `srclayer` as an example, if its connection type is,

* kOneToOne, then each unrolled layer is connected with one unrolled layer from the i-th `srclayer`.
* kOneToALL, then each unrolled layer is connected with all unrolled layers from the i-th `srclayer`.

## Implementation

### Neural net configuration preprocessing

User configured neural net is preprocessed to unroll the recurrent layers,
i.e., duplicating the configuration of the `GRULayer`s, renaming the name of
each layer with unrolling index, and re-configuring the `srclayer` field. After
preprocessing, each layer's name is changed to
`<unrolling_index>#<user_configured_name>.`  Consequently, the (unrolled) neural
net configuration passed to NeuralNet class includes all layers and their
connections.  The NeuralNet class creates and setup each layer in the same way
as for other models.  For example, after partitioning, each layer's name is
changed to `<layer_name>@<partition_index>`. One difference is that it has some
special code for sharing Param data and grad Blobs for layers unrolled from the
same original layer.

Users can visualize the neural net structure using the Python script `tool/graph.py`
and the files in *WORKSPACE/visualization/*. For example, after the training program
is started,

    python tool/graph.py examples/char-rnn/visualization/train_net.json

The generated image file is shown in Fig.3 for `unroll_len=5`,

### BPTTWorker

The BPTT (back-propagation through time) algorithm is typically used to compute
gradients of the objective loss w.r.t. parameters for RNN models. It forwards
propagates through all unrolled layers (i.e., timepoints) to compute features
of each layer, and backwards propagates to compute gradients of parameters. It
is the same as the BP algorithm for feed-forward models if the recurrent layers
are unrolled infinite times. In practice, due to the constraint of memory, the
truncated BPTT is widely used.  It unrolls the recurrent layers a fixed
(truncated) times (controlled by `unroll_len`).  In SINGA, a BPTTWorker is
provided to run the truncated BPTT algorithm for each mini-batch (i.e.,
iteration).  The pseudo code is

```
BPTTWorker::Forward(phase, net) {
  for each layer in net
    if layer.unroll_index() == 0
      Get(layer.params());   // fetch params values from servers
    srclayers = layer.srclayer();
    if phase & kTest
      srclayers.push_back(net->GetConextLayer(layer))
    layer.ComputeFeature(phase, srclayers)
}

BPTTWorker::Backward(phase, net) {
  for each layer in reverse(net.layers())
    layer.ComputeGradient(layer.srclayers())
    if layer.unroll_index() == 0
      Update(layer.params());   // send params gradients to servers
}
```

The testing phase is processed specially. Because the test phase may sample a
long sequence of data (e.g., sampling a piece of Linux kernel code), which
requires many unrolled layers (e.g., more than 1000 characters/layers). But we
cannot unroll the recurrent layers too many times due to memory constraint.
The special line add the 0-th unrolled layer as one of its own source layer.
Consequently, it dynamically adds a recurrent connection to the recurrent layer
(e.g., GRULayer). Then we can sample from the model for infinite times. Taking
the char-rnn model as an example, the test job can be configured as

    test_steps: 10000
    train_one_batch {
      Alg: kBPTT
    }
    net {
      // do not set the unroll_len
      layer {
        // do not set the unroll_len
      }
      â€¦
    }

The instructions for [running test](test.html) is the same for feed-forward
models.
